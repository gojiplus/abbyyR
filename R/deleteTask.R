#' Delete Task
#'
#' Deletes task and associated data. While Abbyy says, "If you try to delete the task that has already been deleted, the successful response is returned," 
#' it doesn't appear to hold. Hence, the function now defaults to checking the status of the task via \code{\link{getTaskStatus}}, and 
#' deletes only if it hasn't been deleted. 
#'  
#' The function by default prints the status of the task you are trying to delete. It will show up as 'deleted' if successful.
#' 
#' @param taskId Required; ID of the task; String
#' @param \dots Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{abbyy_GET}}.
#' 
#' @return Data frame with all the details of the task you are trying to delete: 
#' id (task id), registrationTime, statusChangeTime, status (Submitted, Queued, InProgress, 
#' Completed, ProcessingFailed, Deleted, NotEnoughCredits), filesCount (No. of files), credits, 
#' resultUrl (URL for the processed file if applicable)
#'
